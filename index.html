                    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        Veraith is a solo brand design project that grew out of my interest in sustainable fashion and how credibility is communicated online. I wanted to explore how a clear brand identity and thoughtful visual decisions could make sustainable shopping feel
                        more trustworthy, approachable, and easy to navigate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rather than designing an entire e-commerce platform, I focused on a single core task flow: selecting a product, adding it to the cart, and proceeding to checkout. This allowed me to go deeper into the visual system, hierarchy, and interaction decisions
                        that support a confident purchasing experience.

                    <h3>Brand Challenge</h3>
                    <p>
                        Many sustainable fashion platforms rely heavily on messaging to communicate their values, but often fall short in visual clarity and usability. As a result, users may feel uncertain about product quality, brand values, or where to focus their attention
                        while shopping.

                    <h3>Brand Strategy</h3>
                    <p>
                        My strategy focused on using consistency and visual hierarchy to reduce cognitive load and guide users through the experience with confidence. I made intentional choices around spacing, contrast, and tone to support recognition and reinforce Veraith's
                        sustainability values without overwhelming the interface.

                    <p>
                        The identity system uses a neutral, grounded colour palette paired with refined typography to communicate calm, quality, and transparency. Hierarchy and layout rules were designed to be flexible, allowing the system to scale across different screen sizes
                        while maintaining a consistent brand feel.

                        The system was applied across desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts, adapting components and spacing to each context while preserving visual consistency. This helped me think more critically about how brand systems behave in real-world, responsive environments.

                        This project does not represent a fully built e-commerce platform. Instead, I intentionally focused on a single, high-impact task flow to explore how brand systems and interaction design work together at a critical decision point in the user journey.

                    <p>
                        This project strengthened my understanding of how branding extends beyond aesthetics into usability, perception, and trust. If I were to continue this work, I would explore applying the system to print to further test out its flexibility across physical
                        and digital touchpoints.
