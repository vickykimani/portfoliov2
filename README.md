# Portfolio
A thoughtfully designed portfolio website showcasing selected UX and interface design work, with an emphasis on clarity, systems thinking, and responsive execution. <br>

This site was designed and built from scratch to explore how visual design, interaction patterns, and front-end implementation work together in a real portfolio context.

## Features
- **Responsive Layout** - Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports, including custom hamburger navigation for smaller screens.
- **Case Study Structure** - Projects are presented as focused case studies, highlighting design intent, decision-making, and application rather than just final results.
- **Design System Thinking** - Consistent typography, spacing, and hierarchy applied across sections to reflect brand and usability principles.
- **Clean & Minimal Interface** - A visual style that keeps attention on content and work.
- **Mobile Interaction Patterns** - Subtle transitions, refined buttons, and intentional hover states designed for both mouse and touch input.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 - semantic structure
- CSS3 - Flexbox, Grid, media queries, responsive typography
- Vanilla JavaScript - navigation and interactive behaviour
- Figma - design exploration, wireframes, and mockup
